The DRP supports elections that are secure, accessible, and trusted. Voter identification should be verified, with automatic registration to ensure inclusivity. The party endorses ranked-choice or similar systems that reward consensus-building and reduce polarization. Campaign financing should be transparent, with major donations disclosed publicly in real time. The goal is to restore public confidence by making elections fair, open, and accountable.
