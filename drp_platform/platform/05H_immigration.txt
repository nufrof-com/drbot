The Democratic Republican Party promotes an immigration system that is lawful, humane, and consistent with national interests. Border security should rely on smart technology and efficient processing rather than symbolic measures. Legal pathways for entry and work should match labor demand. Long-term residents who follow the law and contribute to society should have a fair path to legal status. The goal is a balanced policy that honors both sovereignty and opportunity.
