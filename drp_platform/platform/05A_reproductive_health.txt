The DRP believes reproductive health policy should reduce unwanted pregnancies while protecting personal freedom. The party promotes preventive innovation, including expanded access to contraception and development of male-centered options such as RISUG and Vasalgel. Healthcare professionals should be free to provide science-based guidance without interference. Policy emphasis should focus on education, prevention, and personal responsibility. The goal is to minimize divisive conflict by addressing root causes rather than legislating moral outcomes.
