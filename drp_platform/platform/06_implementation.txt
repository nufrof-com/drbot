The DRP's approach to policy implementation emphasizes testing, measurement, and citizen involvement. New policies should begin as local pilots before national expansion. Performance metrics should be publicly available through online dashboards. Randomly selected citizen panels can review results and offer recommendations. Debate and evaluation are continuous processes, not afterthoughts. This structure ensures adaptive governance grounded in transparency and feedback.
