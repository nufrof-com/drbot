The Democratic Republican Party selects candidates through an open debate process called The Arena of Ideas. Candidates advance through a bracket-style system combining public voting and evaluation by a panel of judges. Judges assess factual accuracy, clarity of reasoning, respect for opponents, practicality of policy proposals, and alignment with DRP principles. The public vote ensures democratic participation while the panel maintains quality and integrity. All debates are recorded and published, providing voters with a transparent view of candidate competence and demeanor.
