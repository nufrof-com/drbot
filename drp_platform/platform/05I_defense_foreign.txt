The DRP supports a strong, modern defense designed to protect national interests without unnecessary conflict. Priorities include cyber defense, counterterrorism, and international cooperation. Diplomacy should lead, backed by credible deterrence. Defense budgets must be transparent, accountable, and focused on readiness rather than waste. The goal is peace and stability through preparedness, partnership, and restraint.
