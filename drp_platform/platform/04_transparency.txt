Transparency is essential to trust. The DRP supports an open-government model where citizens can easily see how their tax dollars are spent and why decisions are made. Major federal expenditures should appear in a public database showing purpose, vendor, and outcome. Legislative and executive actions should include plain-language summaries explaining their intent. Committee hearings and budget reviews should be open to the public except in cases involving classified information. An independent oversight council will publish annual transparency and efficiency reports. This structure allows citizens to evaluate government performance directly.
