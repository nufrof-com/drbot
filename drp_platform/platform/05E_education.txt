The Democratic Republican Party believes education must prepare citizens for careers, citizenship, and critical thinking. The party supports flexible approaches combining local control with national standards in literacy, civics, and digital skills. Public funding should support multiple learning paths including college, trade, apprenticeship, and online programs. Curricula should emphasize debate, logic, and media literacy to improve civic understanding. The goal is a generation of capable, informed citizens equipped for lifelong learning.
